### Daring is now maintained by [Brandon Istenes](https://github.com/brandones/Daring) on Github.

**NO LONGER MAINTAINED** I'm no longer maintaing this project having moved my blog to Jekyll. The last version this theme was tested against Ghost was version 1.00.

# Daring

Inspired by John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) link blog, Daring is a similar theme for users of Ghost. It favours text over images and doesn't handle cover images or post images in Ghost.

Daring is based on the excellent [Poole](http://getpoole.com) by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

## Usage

Daring is built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a great starting point for Jekyll but also works well when used with Ghost.

To download, visit the [releases](https://github.com/matthewl/Daring/releases) page.

Daring contains pre-built themes for the following colours:

- Red
- Orange
- Green
- Purple
- Brown
- Blue

Each of these pre-built themes can be found in the `themes` folder.

Simply, upload the compressed theme that you want to use to Ghost and activate it.
